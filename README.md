# Download extensions 
You'll need to Platform Movement Object, the Easing Object, and the Discord Rich Presence Object. The Platform Movement Object and the Easing Object can be installed inside fusion itself, but you'll need to manually install the Discord Rich Presence Object yourself.

Discord Rich Presence Object: https://community.clickteam.com/threads/105184-DRPC-Discord-Rich-Presence-Extension

You're done! Open up the file in Clickteam and muck arround!
